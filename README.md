# media-maker
A twitter-like social media platform with additional methods of filtering and viewing user posts.

The motivation behind  the application was to  offer a social media platform where one can filter their feed based on select parameters.

Media Maker uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Handlebars, Express, NodeMailer, and Bulma, as well as a plethora of npm packages.

The app was assembled with Galen  handling the GUI, Braxton  handling the SQL and Nodemailer, and Kurt handling the Javascript and bringing it to fruition
The main challenges were connecting the front end to the back end, as well as perfecting version control.

All in all the attempt was a success as we were able to have a functioning social media platform with a fully-operating feed, utilizing several core techniques as well as exploring new technologies.



## Installation

Use the packages listed in the package.json - bcrypt,dotenv, express, mysql2, sequelize, and nodemailer. install using npm.
## Usage
